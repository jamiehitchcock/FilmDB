## FilmDB

FilmDB is a film database web app. This is created using React.js and uses an API called 'themoviedb'. Initially FilmDB shows the films that are currently the most popular. You can search for your favourite film and FilmDB will return a snapshot of this film such as the poster, plot summary and rating.
